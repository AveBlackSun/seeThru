#jQuery seeThru - HTML5 video with alpha channel transparencies#

This jQuery plugin adds support for the lacking alpha channel in HTML5 `<video>` elements.<br/>The original data will simply be re-rendered into a canvas-element, therefore adding support for alpha information that can either be included in the source file for the video element or in a seperate `<img>`-element.

##Video setup##
In default configuration the plugin assumes that the alpha information is added underneath the original video track (in the exact same dimensions, therefore a video of 400x300 target dimensions will have a 400x600 source file). The alpha information should be a black and white image with white being fully opaque and black being fully transparent (colored information will be used based on its overall luminance).<br/>For optimal results the color channel should be un-premultiplied. (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing for more info on what that is all about). If you need a tool to un-premultiply your imagery you can use Knoll Unmult which is available for quite a lot of packages: http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/knoll-unmult-free/<br/>
For a basic introduction of how to encode and embed video for HTML5 pages see the great http://www.diveintohtml5.info/video.html
###Example image:###
Note the jagged edges in the color channel(s) due to un-premultiplying:<br/>

##Static Mask##
It is also possible to source the alpha information from an `<img>`-element. The plugin lets you use either the luminance information of the RGB channels (i.e. the image) or the image's alpha channel (see options for how to choose). In case the image does not fit your video's dimensions it will be stretched to those.<br/>

##Basic plugin usage##
Basic HTML5 video markup should look something like this:

```html
<video id="myVideo">
    <source src="src.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <source src="src.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
    ....
</video>
```

In case you are planning to have your video set to autoplay or loop you can do this when initializing the JS. The plugin will also fix the lack of a loop option in Firefox.<br/>
To make the magic happen you just have to do the following:<br/>
include jQuery (i built the plugin with 1.7.1 but it should be working with older versions down to 1.3 as well) and the plugin in your `<head>`:

```html 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-seeThru.0.9.6.min.js"></script>
```
and then call the following jQuery method on your video (preferrably on `$(document).ready`):

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('#myVideo').seeThru();
});
```

If you specify dimension-attributes in your markup they will be considered, in case not the dimensions of the source file will be used (video with alpha included will of course turn out to be halved in height). To avoid flickering on pageload I'd recommend setting your video to `display:none;` in your CSS.<br/>In case you want to style the generated canvas elements, the generated markup looks like this:
```html
<video style="display:none;">...</video><!-- video is hidden -->
<canvas height="XXX" width="XXX" class="seeThru-display"></canvas><!-- this is the actual "video" -->
<canvas height="XXX" width="XXX" class="seeThru-buffer" style="display:none;"></canvas><!-- this is just a helper element -->
```
##Options##
There are a few options you can pass when calling the plugin:

 - `fps` expects a number specifying the frame rate that will be used for rendering the video. It defaults to `25` and should be adjusted to the frame rate of your source file for best results. If you are concerned about performance issues you can try decreasing the frame rate and therefore reduce the rendering effort the browser has to handle.
 - `start` defines the video's behavior on load. It defaults to `'autoplay'` which will automatically start the video as soon as possible. Other options are `'clicktoplay'` which will display the first frame of the video until it is clicked or `'external'` which will just display the first frame of the video and wait for external JS calls (so you can build your own interface or something - note that although the `<video>` is hidden it is still playing and controls the rendered image).
 - `end` defines the video's behavior when it has reached its end. It defaults to `'loop'` which will loop the video. Other possibilities are `'stop'` (it will just stop), or `'rewind'` which will jump back to the first frame and stop. If you use `start:'clicktoplay'` along with `'rewind'` or `'end'` the video will be clickable again when finished.
 - `mask` lets you use the content of an `<img>` node as alpha information (also black and white). The parameter expects a CSS selector (preferrably ID) that refers directly to an image tag, like `'#fancyMask'`. In case multiple elements are matched (class passed) the first element is used, in case the selector matches nothing or a non-image node the option is ignored. Defaults to an empty string, so video information is used for the alpha.
 - `alphaMask` specifies if the plugin uses either the black and white information (i.e. `false`) or the alpha information (i.e. `true`) of the element specified in the `mask` parameter. Defaults to `false`.
 - `height` can be used to control the height of the rendered canvas. Overrides the attributes of the `<video>`-element
 - `width` can be used to control the width of the rendered canvas. Overrides the attributes of the `<video>`-element
 - `forceRendering` is a flag used to control if the browser will stop rendering the canvas elements when they are scrolled out of the viewport (therefore not visible). This is set to false by default as it greatly improves performance (especially with more than one video on a single page), yet if it messes with something you want to do with the canvas elements you can always set the option to true and the canvas will be forced to update all the time.


This might look like this:
```javascript
$('#myVideo').seeThru({fps:12,start:'autoplay',end:'stop'});
```
or
```javascript
$('#myVideo').seeThru({mask:'#imageWithAlpha',alphaMask: true});
```
##Additional methods##
Apart from `init`, these methods are available:

 - `updateMask` lets you swap the alpha source for a video that uses static alpha information. Has to be used along with a new selector as `mask` parameter, the value for `alphaMask` will be kept from init.
 - `revert` will revert the `<video>` element back to its original state, remove the `<canvas>` elements, all attached data and event listeners/handlers
 - `play` and `pause` can be used to control the playback of the video - basically the same as `$('#video')[0].play()`, but still chainable

This might look like:
```javascript
$('#myVideo').seeThru('updateMask',{mask:'#newMask'});
```
or
```javascript
$('#myVideo').seeThru('revert').addClass('plainOldVideo');
```
or
```javascript
$('#myVideo').seeThru('pause').next('.seeThru-display').one('click',function(){
   $('#myVideo').seeThru('play');
});
```

##Cross Domain issues with canvas-elements##
Please note that canvas is very picky about where it gets its contents from, so be aware that the video source file has to be hosted on the same domain.

##Mobile devices##
As most mobile devices use external video players to handle HTML5-video this plugin is *not* working on mobile Safari or Webkit (yet). This is definitely on our to-do-list (wishlist rather), although outcome is uncertain.

##Browser support##
Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera 11 and IE 9.0+ 
(the browser has to support `<video>` and `<canvas>` of course)<br/>If you are looking for a tool to detect these features you should have a look at <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">modernizr</a>

##tl;dr##
Put a black-and white alpha channel right underneath your `<video>` source (in the same file), load jQuery and let the plugin do magical things:
<code>
$('#myRadVideoNeedsTransparencies').seeThru();
</code><br>
Voila! Here's an [example][1].
